# What happened

It's been a while since my last post, a full year has passed since I decided to make the birthday present for my friend, a Game Boy game. I just spent a lot of time studying and travelling. I went to Japan and I think I've developed a passion for electronics, I've been studying quite a lot of physics, chemistry and electronics as well in parallel with my Open University studies (which mostly covers basic engineering concepts at the moment).

After so many years of runnign away from formal education, I'm studying by myself, loving university and enjoying what I do.

# Moving from Amsterdam back to Romania

While I was able to focus more and more on electronics I realised that my current lifestyle doesn't match with the city I currently live in, Amsterdam. The high consumer and rent prices aren't the best companion when trying to spend some time (years?) studying.

Therefore I decided, together with my girlfriend (and obviously my dog as well) to move back to Romania where I own an apartment and can live rent-free for quite some time. The quality of life there is definitely lower than in Amsterdam, but my focus is at the moment learning, not living in a fancy city in a fancy house.

So, new adventures await. I'll be joining back my team from the company I've built a long while ago, so I have friends and coworkers expecting me. I'm excited for a new adventure.

# My trip(s) to Japan

I've been twice this year to Japan. It's been eye-opening and incredible. It was also the first time I've traveled by myself without any plan.

It's quite weird to go somewhere, where nobody is expecting you, having no plan, just landing in the middle of the city and asking yourself "So, what should I do now?". 

I knew some basic sentences and words in Japanese to get around. But I never expected to have a full discussion in Japanese with a 73 year old piano tuner in Shinjuku, while getting hammered with him.

I've made quite a lot of friends there, which even visited me in Amsterdam. And I also took on my second trip there my father which was in complete shock of the culture and the major differences between Europe and Asia.

Japanese people are incredibly friendly and Tokyo is just magic, I fell particularly in love with Akihabara. I'm now planning that after returning to Romania I'll go to Japan once again.

# Learning Japanese

I've been studying Japanese until around June. I've suddenly stopped as my Japanese teacher didn't want to do the lessons anymore. It's something which I've enjoyed quite a lot and will get back to it once things settle down.

# Learning electronics, physics, chemistry and calculus 

I now am the proud owner of a ton of exceptional books:

* Ohanian Physics
* The Art of Electronics
* Practical Electronics for Inventors
* Circuit Designer's Companion
* Designing Analog Chips

These books, along with my studies at Open University have been an incredible experience. There is a Master degree at University of Boulder, Colorado in Semiconductors which I would definitely enjoy joining, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get in next year unless I really study hard.
