<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>I never studied software engineering in an academic setup, but somehow I got to the point in which I was confident with my software development skills. Obviously I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything too fancy but it was enough for me. Recently as you can see from my blog I started getting into electrical engineering. I discovered that I had a huge knowledge gap, as I didn&rsquo;t understand how the electrical part of the computers I was coding for was working, nor did I know how they functioned on a really low level. So luckly <a href="http://vladh.net">vladh</a> recommended me this course, and I loved it.</p>

<h1 id="about-the-course">About the course</h1>

<p>Around 8 weeks ago I started <a href="https://nand2tetris.org">nand2tetris</a>, a fantastic course that I took on Coursera (called there &ldquo;Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris&rdquo;) tought by two professors from Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The course takes you on a 6 week trip from building XOR, OR, AND, etc. chips using solely a NAND gate using HDL (Hardware Description Language) up until you&rsquo;ve built using those gates an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and further a CPU that can handle different types of operations (keyboard reading as well as displaying stuff on a virtual screen).</p>

<h1 id="writing-an-assembler">Writing an assembler</h1>

<p>In the last week you get to write an assembler for the PC you&rsquo;ve built so you don&rsquo;t have to write machine code for it. I&rsquo;ve done this initially in Python, but I&rsquo;m now rewriting it in C as I&rsquo;m currently learning the language.</p>

<p>You can see the progress that I&rsquo;ve done by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/petrutoader/hack-assembler">repository of the assembler</a>.</p>

<h1 id="writing-an-operating-system">Writing an operating system</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently thinking of starting the next course of the series which goes a lot deeper into the software engineering side of building a computer. From the reviews I saw that it&rsquo;s a ton of work and I have to make sure I have time planned for it. The main idea behind it is to get to the point in which you can play tetris on the computer, obviously for that you&rsquo;ll need a lot more than a simple assembler.</p>
