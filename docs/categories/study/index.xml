      <description>Motivation I never studied software engineering in an academic setup, but somehow I got to the point in which I was confident with my software development skills. Obviously I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing anything too fancy but it was enough for me. Recently as you can see from my blog I started getting into electrical engineering. I discovered that I had a huge knowledge gap, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how the electrical part of the computers I was coding for was working, nor did I know how they functioned on a really low level.</description>
